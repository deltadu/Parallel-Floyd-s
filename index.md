## Welcome to Parallel Floyd's Algorithm

### Introduction
A central problem in algorithmic graph theory is the shortest path problem. Hereby, the problem of finding the shortest path between every pair of nodes is known as all-pair-shortest-paths (APSP) problem. As sequential algorithms for this problem often yield long runtimes, parallelization has shown to be beneficial in this field. In this project we will try to approach the problem with OpenMP and MPI.
